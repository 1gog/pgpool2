# Test data for bug271.
# In an explicit transaction, SELECT is parsed, DML issued, same SELECT/bind issued.
# In this case Pgpool-II should parse resend to primary node.
# Similar to pgproto.data but in this case SELECT uses "S1" statement.
# As of 2017/2/14, this fails.
# <= BE ErrorResponse(S ERROR C XX000 M unable to bind D cannot get parse message "S1" F pool_proto_modules.c L 1317 )
