This directory includes test suites using pgproto.
https://github.com/tatsuo-ishii/pgproto

Overview:

The objective the test suites is testing behaviors of Pgpool-II
running in streaming replication with extended queries. The reason
pgproto used here is, it is very difficult to implement that kind of
tests using standard drivers such as libpq and Java because no low
level APIs are provided in the drivers.

How to run the test:

./test.sh

The script runs each pgproto test data under "tests" directory using
pgproto command. The each result is compared with data under
"expected" directory.

How to add tests:

Add pgproto data under "tests" directory. Also you need to add
expected output of pgproto to "expected" directory. The file name must
be identical to the file name added to tests directory.

If you need to add special directives to pgpool.conf, include those
configuration directives to the pgproto data starting with "##". You
can see examples in parse-before-bind.data.
