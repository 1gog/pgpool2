 <title>Server Setup and Operation</title>

 <para>
  This chapter discusses how to set up and run the pgpool-II server
  and its interactions with the operating system.

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   As with any server daemon that is accessible to the outside world,
   it is advisable to run <productname>pgpool-II</productname> under a
   separate user account. This user account should only own the data
   that is managed by the server, and should not be shared with other
   daemons. (For example, using the user <literal>nobody</literal> is a bad
   idea.) It is not advisable to install executables owned by this
   user because compromised systems could then modify their own
   binaries.
  </para>

  <para>
   To add a Unix user account to your system, look for a command
   <command>useradd</command> or <command>adduser</command>. The user
   name <systemitem>pgpool</systemitem> is often used, and is assumed
   throughout this book, but you can use another name if you like.

  <para>
    <productname>pgpool-II</productname> provides a control interface
    where an administrator can
    collect <productname>pgpool-II</productname> status, and terminate
    <productname>pgpool-II</productname> processes
    remotely. <filename>pcp.conf</filename> is the user/password file
    used for authentication by this interface. All operation modes
    require the <filename>pcp.conf</filename> file to be set. A
    <filename>$prefix/etc/pcp.conf.sample</filename> file is created
    during the installation
    of <productname>pgpool-II</productname>. Rename the file to
    <filename>pcp.conf</filename> and add your user name and password
    to it.

      <programlisting>
cp $prefix/etc/pcp.conf.sample $prefix/etc/pcp.conf
      </programlisting>

      An empty line or a line starting with "#" is treated as a
      comment and will be ignored. A user name and its associated
      password must be written as one line using the following format:

      <programlisting>
username:[password encrypted in md5]
      </programlisting>

[password encrypted in md5] can be produced with the $prefix/bin/pg_md5 command.

      <programlisting>
pg_md5 -p
password: your_password
      </programlisting>

or

      <programlisting>
./pg_md5 foo
acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8
      </programlisting>

      The <filename>pcp.conf</filename> file must be readable by the
      user who executes <productname>pgpool-II</productname>.

    <filename>pgpool.conf</filename> is the main configuration file

    path to the file when

    using <option>-f</option> option.
    <filename>pgpool.conf</filename> is located

 <sect2 id="running-mode">
  <title>Running mode of pgpool-II</title>

  <para>
    There are four different running modes in pgpool-II: streaming
    replication mode, master slave mode, native replication mode and
    raw mode. In any mode, pgpool-II provides connection pooling,
    automatic fail over and online recovery. The sample configuration
    files for each mode are provied. They are located
    under <filename>$prefix/etc</filename>. You can copy one of them
    to <filename>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Those modes are exclusive each other and cannot be changed after
    starting the server. You should make a decision which to use in
    the early stage of designing the system. If you are not sure, it
    is recommended to use the streaming replication mode.
  </para>

  <para>
    The streaming replication mode can be used with PostgreSQL servers
    operating streaming replication. In this mode, PostgreSQL is
    responsible for synchronizing databases. This mode is widely used
    and most recommended way to use pgpool-II. Load balancing is
    possible in the mode.  The sample configuration file
    is <filename>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample-stream</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The master slave mode mode can be used with PostgreSQL servers
    operating Slony. In this mode, PostgreSQL is responsible for
    synchronizing databases. This Slony is being obsoletd by streaming
    replication, we do not recommend to use this mode unless you have
    specific reason to use Slony. Load balancing is possible in the
    mode. The sample configuration file
    is <filename>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample-master-slave</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    In the native replication mode, pgpool-II is responsible for
    synchronizing databases. The advantage for the mode is the
    synchronization is done in synchronous way: writing to the
    database does not return until all of PostgreSQL servers finish
    the write operation. Note, however, read snapshot control is not
    done and consistent visibility is not guaranteed in the mode.
    Load balancing is possible in the mode. The sample configuration
    file <filename>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample-replication</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    In the raw mode, pgpool-II does not care about the database
    synchronization. It's user's responsibility to make the whole
    system does a meaningfull thing. Load balancing
    is <emphasis>not</emphasis> possible in the mode. The sample
    configuration
    file <filename>$prefix/etc/pgpool.conf.sample</filename>.
