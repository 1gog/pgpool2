	  The solution is, in #3, let Pgpool-II wait for response from backend

	  machine will read the response from it before the sync message is sent
	  in #6. With this, backend 1 will reply back "1" in #8, and the kind
	  mismatch error does not occur.

	  Fix a race condition in a signal handler per bug 265. (Tatsuo Ishii)
	</para>
	<para>
	  In child.c there's signal handler which calls elog. Since the signal
	  handler is not blocked against other signals while processing, deadlock
	  could occur in the system calls in the pgpool shutdown sequence. To
	  fix the problem, now the signal handler is blocked by using
	  POOL_SETMASK.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Ideally we should avoid calling elog in signal handlers though.

	  Back porting the improved failover command propagation mechanism from Pgpool-II 3.6 (Muhammad Usama)
	</para>
	<para>
	  Overhauling the design of how failover, failback and promote node commands are
	  propagated to the watchdog nodes. Previously the watchdog on pgpool-II node that
	  needs to perform the node command (failover, failback or promote node) used to
	  broadcast the failover command to all attached pgpool-II nodes. And this
	  sometimes makes the synchronization issues, especially when the watchdog cluster
	  contains a large number of nodes and consequently the failover command sometimes
	  gets executed by more than one pgpool-II.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Now with this commit all the node commands are forwarded to the
	  master/coordinator watchdog, which in turn propagates to all standby nodes.
	  Apart from above the commit also changes the failover command interlocking
	  mechanism and now only the master/coordinator node can become the lock holder
	  so the failover commands will only get executed on the master/coordinator node.

	  Fix the case when all backends are down then 1 node attached. (Tatsuo Ishii)
	</para>
	<para>
	  When all backends are down, no connection is accepted. Then 1
	  PostgreSQL becomes up, and attach the node using pcp_attach_node. It
	  successfully finishes. However, when a new connection arrives, still
	  the connection is refused because pgpool child process looks into the
	  cached status, in which the recovered node is still in down status if
	  mode is streaming replication mode (native replication and other modes
	  are fine). Solution is, if all nodes are down, force to restart all
	  pgpool child.

	  Fix for: [pgpool-general: 4997] Avoiding downtime when pgpool changes require a restart (Muhammad Usama)
	</para>
	<para>
	  To fix this, The verification mechanism of configuration parameter values is
	  reversed, previously the standby nodes used to verify their parameter values
	  against the respective values on the master pgpool-II node and when the
	  inconsistency was found the FATAL error was thrown, now with this commit the
	  verification responsibility is delegated to the master pgpool-II node.
	  Now the master node will verify the configuration parameter values of each
	  joining standby node against its local values and will produce
	  a WARNING message instead of an error in case of a difference.
	  This way the nodes having the different configurations will also be allowed to
	  join the watchdog cluster and the user has to manually look out for the
	  configuration inconsistency warnings in the master pgpool-II log to avoid the
	  surprises at the time of pgpool-II master switch over.

	  flatten_set_variable_args() was imported from PostgreSQL in Pgpool-II
	  3.5. To make the code work, a compiler flag "-fno-strict-aliasing" is
	  necessary (PostgreSQL does so). Unfortunately when the function was
	  imported, the compiler flag was not added. To fix this, configure.ac
	  was modified.

	  Don't ignore sync message from frontend when query cache is enabled. (Tatsuo Ishii)
	</para>
	<para>
	  While returning cached query result, sync message sent from frontend
	  is discarded. This is harmless because "ready for query" messages is
	  sent to frontend afterward. Problem is, AccessShareLock held by
	  previous parse message processing is not released until sync message
	  is received by the backend. Fix is, forwarding the sync message to
	  backend and discarding "ready for query" message returned from
	  backend.
